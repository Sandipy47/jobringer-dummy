# jobringer-dummy
This project i made for my first internship for assignment.

In the project, I created a front-end  responsiveness for mobile web page  that includes:
Job seeker login and registration,
Employer login and registration,
A “Worldwide Jobs” section — when you click on “View More,” it shows job listings from around the world.

You can directly access the web page by netlify.app.
